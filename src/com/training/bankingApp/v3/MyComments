 Suppose now that the bank also wants to  store additional information for each account. 
 In particular, assume that the bank wants to know whether the owner of each account is foreign or domestic. 
 How should the program change?
 
 To solve this, bank’s map can then associate a BankAccount object with each account number.
 
Encapsulation Rule: A class’s implementation details should be hidden from its clients 
as much as possible.
 
using methods are able to limit the power of clients. A public variable is equivalent to both an accessor and a mutator method, 
and having both methods can often be inappropriate. For example, clients of the alternative.
BankAccount class would have the power to change the account number, which is not a good idea.
 
 
The classes of the version 3 banking demo are modular and encapsulated now
